This repository contains the source materials for an ebook written, edited, and designed by students in my Print & Digital Editing course at Miami University.

You can download the free ebook from the iBooks store -- https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/id1372131832 -- or get the epub from this project's [Releases](https://github.com/timlockridge/comewritehere/releases/) area.

The book is written in Markdown (for Pandoc production). Thanks to @evangoer for the intial Makefile.
